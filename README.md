## Overview
### Chapter 1
Chapter 1 examines solar energy adoption patterns across Pakistani districts by analyzing data
from the 2023 Digital Census and satellite nightlight imagery. This chapter investigates how
socio-economic factors, access to grid electricity, and regional differences influence solar
uptake using statistical and machine learning models.
### Chapter 2
Chapter 2 focuses on household-level solar net metering behavior in Lahore and neighboring
districts, including Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Okara, and Sheikhupura, using monthly data
provided by Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO). It evaluates the effects of policy
changes in net metering buyback rates from 2022 to 2025 on consumer solar usage and
adoption.
### Chapter 3
Chapter 3 integrates the findings from the previous two chapters to explore the relationship
between district-level solar adoption trends and household responses to net metering policies.
It presents a summary of the key findings, discusses limitations, and outlines directions for
future research to support Pakistan’s transition to sustainable energy. This synthesis provides
a holistic view of solar energy uptake and informs targeted policy recommendations.
